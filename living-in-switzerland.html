        <h1>Living in Switzerland</h1>

        <p>
            Oftentimes I get asked on advice regarding moving to Switzerland and I have difficulties giving
            an answer. I know people on both sides of the spectrum - I have met some who have grown fondly
            attached to the country and I have met others who are deeply dissatisfied with their stay. I believe that
            such type of a
            choice is highly personal and it is impossible to come to a decision just from anecdotal information about
            the country.
            What I would suggest is to take time to visit Switzerland, read about it and reflect on whether it makes
            sense to make a move.
            <br>
            Below are some sources I used for my own research.
